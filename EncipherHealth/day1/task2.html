    <h3>The Reason I Chose HTML</h3>
    <p>
        I want to learn HTML because I prefer understanding things from the basics rather than jumping ahead. Knowing how a webpage is built helps me see the structure clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since I’m aiming to grow in full stack development, learning HTML gives me the right foundation. When I understand this part well, moving to CSS, JavaScript, and other tools becomes simpler and less confusing.

    </p>
    <p>
        I’m attending this training because I want to build practical skills and get hands-on experience. Learning HTML here gives me a strong starting point and increases my chances of contributing well if I get an opportunity to work in the company.
