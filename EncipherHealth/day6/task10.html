<h1>Why Learn HTML</h1>

<h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
<p>
    HTML is the starting point for almost every page you see on the internet. 
    When you learn HTML, you understand how a web page is built and how different 
    parts of a page are arranged. This makes the web feel less like magic and more 
    like something you can create and control.
</p>

<h2>Building Your Own Web Pages</h2>
<p>
    Knowing HTML allows you to design simple pages for your own use, such as 
    personal profiles, project summaries, or small portfolios. Even if the design 
    is basic, creating something from scratch gives a strong sense of confidence 
    and ownership over your work.
</p>

<h2>Foundation for Other Skills</h2>
<p>
    HTML is often the first step before learning other web technologies like CSS, 
    JavaScript, and frameworks. Once you are comfortable with HTML, it becomes 
    easier to understand how styling and interactivity are added on top of a page. 
    A clear HTML structure makes future learning smoother and less confusing.
