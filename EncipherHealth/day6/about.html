<h2>The Origin of the Sky Kingdom</h2>
<p>
    Long ago, when the earth was filled with wars and noise, a group of mages 
    wished for a place where knowledge and peace could live together. 
    They lifted a piece of land into the sky and named it <b>Eldoria</b>. 
    Over time, it grew into a full kingdom drifting gently above the clouds.

<h2>The Guardians of Eldoria</h2>

    <li>The River Spirit - keeps the glowing rivers pure.</li>
    <li>The Tree of Echoes - remembers every voice it has ever heard.</li>

    Some say that if you close your eyes and wish with a calm heart, 
    you might hear the wind of Eldoria calling your name.
