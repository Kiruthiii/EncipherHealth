    <h2>Why Stories Matter</h2>
    <h3>The Power of Imagination</h3>
    <h4>How Books Shape Our Mind</h4>
    <h5>Reading in the Digital Age</h5>
    <h6>The Journey Continues</h6>

    <p>
        Books have the power to take us to places we've never seen and introduce us 
        to people we've never met. When we read, our <b>imagination expands</b>, allowing 
        us to explore entire worlds with just a few pages. Whether it's a mystery or 
        fantasy novel, every story gives us a <mark>unique experience</mark>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reading helps us grow mentally and emotionally. It improves our 
        <i>vocabulary</i>, sharpens our thinking, and makes us more understanding. 
        Books act like a <u>silent companion</u>, offering comfort, knowledge, and escape. 
        A chapter can fill our mind with <b>creative energy</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even in today's digital world, the joy of reading remains special. E-books 
        have made reading <mark>accessible</mark>, but the charm of a physical book is 
        unmatched. Reading will always be a <b>powerful habit</b> that builds wisdom, 
        peace, and self-connection.
