    <h2 style="color:brown;"><i>Chapter 1: The Lantern in the River</i></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a cold evening in the village of Aravel, Mira spotted something unusual drifting down the silent river — a lantern glowing with a soft blue light. It wasn’t like any lantern she had seen before. It moved against the current, slowly coming toward her, as if it had chosen her.

Curious, she reached out and picked it up. The moment her fingers touched the glass, the flame inside flickered wildly and revealed a message engraved on the metal frame:

“Follow the light you cannot see.”

Before she could make sense of it, the lantern pulse-glowed, and the path behind her lit up faintly, one stone at a time.</p>

<h2 class="Chapter2"><i>Chapter2:The Path That Didn’t Exist Yesterday</i></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mira hesitated. That path wasn’t there before — she was sure of it. Yet the lantern insisted, glowing brighter each time she stepped closer. With a deep breath, she followed it into the forest.

But the forest wasn’t the same anymore. Trees whispered her name. Shadows moved even without wind. The air felt old… ancient. After a long walk, she reached an abandoned stone gate covered in vines.

The lantern floated out of her hand and hovered before the gate. The stones shifted, forming symbols she didn’t recognize. Suddenly, the gate opened with a low rumble.

Behind it was not a forest.

It was a city — glowing, silent, and alive with light.</p>
<h2 class="Chapter3"><i>Chapter 3: The City That Chose Her</i></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city shimmered like stardust. Buildings floated. Bridges twisted in mid-air. Lanterns—glowing the same blue as hers—floated everywhere like tiny spirits.

A tall figure approached her, cloaked in silver.

“You found the First Lantern,” the figure said. “That means the city has chosen you.”

Mira felt a strange excitement rising inside her. “Chosen me for what?”

“To restore the light of Aravel,” the figure replied. “The lanterns are dying. Only someone who sees beyond what others see can guide them.”

The lantern in her hand glowed brighter, as if agreeing.

Mira took a breath, stepped forward, and accepted the path awaiting her — a path that began with a single floating lantern and would lead her into mysteries far beyond her world.</p>
