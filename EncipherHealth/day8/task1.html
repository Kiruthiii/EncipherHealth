    <h2>The Echo Gate</h2>
    <section id="#Echogate">
        The Echo Gate opens to a realm where moments are never fully lost.
Here, memories wander softly, and certain experiences feel strangely familiar even when they shouldn't.
Visitors step into a space where time loops, feelings repeat, and thoughts drift between the present and the almost-remembered.

    <section id="#MemoryRooms">
        Room of Faint Whispers
Shadows of conversations that never happened, yet feel strangely real.

Room of Half-Remembered Paths
Hallways that seem familiar, even though you've never walked them before.

Room of Repeated Feelings
Emotions that return without warning — déjà senti, déjà vécu, déjà visité.

Each room mirrors the experience of déjà vu:
a spark of recognition,
a soft tug on the mind,
a brief “I've been here before.”

                <h3>The Psychology of Déjà Vu: Why Moments Feel Repeated</h3>

                <p>
                    Déjà vu — a French phrase meaning “already seen” — describes the eerie
                    feeling that a new situation feels strangely familiar. It lasts only a
                    second or two, but it can leave a strong impression, as if time briefly
                    looped or memory slipped.
                </p>

                <h4>1. A Glitch in Memory Processing</h4>
                <p>
                    Déjà vu often happens when the brain processes incoming information a
                    fraction too slowly. You receive the moment twice — once imperfectly,
                    once clearly. The second time feels like a memory, even though it isn't.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Neural Overlap with Old Memories</h4>
                <p>
                    Present experiences sometimes resemble stored memories. Not exact
                    matches, but similar shapes or emotions. The brain reacts with a soft
                    “I’ve felt this before.”
                </p>

                <h4>3. The Brain's Internal Error Check</h4>
                <p>
                    Scientists believe déjà vu may be a system check. When something feels
                    “off,” the brain pauses to verify reality. That pause feels like
                    recognition.
                </p>

                <h4>4. Stress, Fatigue, and Overthinking</h4>
                <p>
                    Déjà vu occurs more during tired or overwhelmed moments, when the mind
                    skips a beat — like a clock stuttering for a second.
                </p>

                <h4>5. The Dream Theory</h4>
                <p>
                    Some think déjà vu is triggered when the present resembles a forgotten
                    dream. The memory is buried, but the feeling remains.
                </p>

                <h4>Why It Feels Magical</h4>
                <p>
                    Déjà vu is when memory and reality blur, when time feels circular, and
                    the universe seems to whisper. A familiar echo in an unfamiliar moment.

            <h2>Side Notes</h2>
            <p>Déjà vu happens to 60–70% of people at least once in their lifetime.</p>
            <p>More common in creative thinkers and deep observers.</p>
            <p>Often appears during calm walks, reading, traveling, or daydreaming.</p>
            <p>Scientists still cannot fully explain it — which keeps its magic alive.</p>

                The Hall of Echoed Moments closes softly as visitors leave.  
                Memories settle. Time straightens.  
                Yet that gentle feeling — “I’ve been here before” — lingers like a whisper.
